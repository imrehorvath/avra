## Release 1.2.3 (2007-11-15, bug fix by Burkhard Arenfeld)

- Fix bug 1697037 (Error with single character ';')
- Better check for line termination. Now a single CR or a FF generates an warning message. Code with bad CR
  termination could appear, if you edit CR-LF terminated files (WIN/DOS) with linux (LF only) editors.
- Fix bug 1462900 (Segfault, if error in -D parameter)
- Fix bug 1742436 (Error in .dseg size check)
- Fix bug 1742437 (Error in EEPROM presence check)
- Add patch 1604128 from Jim Galbraith (New devices ATtiny25/45/85, small fix for ATmega8 (no jmp, call instruction))
- Fix bug in handling of special tags (%HOUR% ...). A % without a special tag was replaced by previous tag value.
- Use a global timestamp for all functions which needs a time (pi->time).
- Fix bug in handling of unknown args (E.g.: avra --abc -> Segfault).
- Fix segfault if .error directive without parameter is used.
- Add a warning, if characters with code > 127 are used in .db strings and fix listing output.
- Take a look at Testcode_avra-1_2_3.asm, which demonstrate some differences between 1.2.3 and previous releases
- AVR000.zip contains some header files for different devices.
- Included avra binary was created with ubuntu 7.10 linux

## Release 1.2.2 (2007-05-11, better error checks by Burkhard Arenfeld)
- Check in print_msg() if filename is NULL. Avoid printing a NULL-Pointer.
- Warning, if no .DEVICE was found, because address range check doesn't work without it
- Error, if more than one .DEVICE was found.
- Error, if .DEVICE is after any assembled code or .ORG directive, because .DEVICE resets the address 
  counters and the assembler builds wrong code.
- Create a list of program segments (see orglist). Every .ORG, .DEVICE, .?SEG is stored, so the 
  assembler now can check for overlapping segments. Now overlapped segments in Flash, Data or EEPROM memory 
  are detected. Very usefull, if .ORG is used to build tables or bootloader code at specific addresses.
- Better check for exceeding device space in RAM, Flash or EEPROM memory. Now not the total count of
  assembled memory is used, instead every assembled address range is checked.
- .DSEG and .ESEG now generates an error, if device has no RAM / EEPROM.
- Now a warning appears, if a .DEF name is already used as constant or label. Atmel assembler generates this
  warning, too.
- Fix a small bug in the example program.

## Release 1.2.1 (2006-11-17, bug fix by Roland Riegel)

- Some of the high end AVRs use the SRAM adress range from 0x60 to 0x100 for IO extension.
  Avra so far used to start with SRAM Usage at 0x60. This is now set from case by case.

## Release 1.2.0 (2006-10-15, released by Burkhard Arenfeld)

- Patch segfault, if .error is given without parameter
- Patch segfault, if .device is given with an invalid parameter
- Check in predef_dev() if symbol is already defined. Can happens, if someone
  tries to define the symbol with the -D parameter. E.g.: `avra -D __ATMEGA8__ Test.asm`
  now generate error message, because `__ATMEGA8__` is reserved
- Add .elseif directive. It's the same like .elif. (Original Atmel assembler use .elseif
  and not .elif)
- In .db lines strings can now contain ',' and ';' characters.
- Allow forward declaration of constants (.equ) except for .ifdef and .ifndef.
  Invalid forward declarations are checked now. (In the first pass undefined Symbols in
  .ifdef and .ifndef parameters are stored in a 'blacklist' and checked in the second pass)
- Extend the .message directive for better debugging. Now it accept not only a String.
  You can use a list of expressions like in a .db directive as parameter.
- The assembler 'pass' variable moved into the pi struct. I deleted the pass variable from
  a lot of functions.
- New functions in avra.c. It was easier for me, to understand the code without the 
  for(label = first; ...)-loops. Replaced a lot of for(label = ...) -loops by one of this
  functions.

## Release 1.1.1 (2006-09-06)

- right shift operator bug
- LPM is supported on ATtiny26 but avra say it isn't
